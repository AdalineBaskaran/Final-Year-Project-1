7) Stress Release 
### Catharsis Theory
Definition of Catharsis
- The process of venting aggression as a way to release or get rid of emotions. 
- When people say something was 'catharsis' meaning it released emotion.
- When you are so angry and went out to yelled or scream. Psychologists call this method catharsis.


### Theory 
- The thought behind catharsis theory is that feelings build up and create pressure if not rented, in the same way air build up in a ballon until it bursts. Releasing emotion decreases the pressure or tension in the person so they have fewer negative emotions and less aggressive.
- Sigmund Freud was the first to use this theory in phychological therapy. The theory states that expressing or getting out one's aggression and anger should reduce the feeling of aggression.
- This research hasn't much to back it up. Studies have demonstrated that expressing anger create more anger or hostility when compared to groups that where not pemitted to express anger. Despite opposing evidence, many people still do believe aggression reduce frustration and future aggression.
- In theorpy setting, catharsis is more than just venting anger. Instead, it's a re-experiencing of a traumatic event and expressing the strong emotions that are associated with them. Therapies that emphasize emotions, such as Gestalt therapy, create role-play simulations to facilitate safe expression of emotion.

### Interaction Flow
User have to step in the box. There will be a screen, a microphone and lights that surround the room. There will be a webcam on the screen that will show your pixelated image on the screen. User then have to shout or scream into the microphone for the image to turn clear and the lights to light up. The louder you scream, the clearer the image will get and the brighter the room.

Idea on how the question system will work

### Interaction Flow
There is a QR code and a screen displaying an image of a girl. When the QR code is scanned with the given tablet, a MCQ question will appear. Based on the image, users have to answer the following question. There are 5 questions total. Each answer will affect the image to change differently. At the end of the question, a pop up box will appear on the tablet with a message based on the image.
